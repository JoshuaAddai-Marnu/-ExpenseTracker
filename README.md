Project Title: Expense Tracker and Budgeting Application

Project Description: Led the design and development of an expense tracker and budgeting application as part of a group coursework project. The application aimed to assist users in tracking their 
expenses, comparing them with a budget, and managing transactions effectively.

Technologies Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, UML diagrams(Astah), C#

Team Role: Project Designer

Key Contributions:
- Collaborated with team members to analyze project requirements and define system functionalities.
- Took the lead in designing the application architecture, including class diagrams, object diagrams, and application of design patterns and heuristics.
- Ensured adherence to OOP principles throughout the design process, emphasizing abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Facilitated discussions on design decisions and resolved design-related issues as they arose during the development phase.

Project Outcome: Successfully designed a robust expense tracker and budgeting application, providing users with essential features such as transaction management, category tracking, budget 
setting, and progress monitoring against budgetary goals.


Lessons Learned: Strengthened proficiency in UML diagramming, software design principles, and collaborative teamwork. Gained valuable experience in leading the design phase of a complex 
software project and translating design concepts into implementation requirements.



Project Status: Completed

Additonal Information:
